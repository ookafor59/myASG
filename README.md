### myASG
This deployment creates an AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) that launches web servers across multiple Availability Zones for improved reliability and performance

Benefits of Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) include the following
High availability: They automatically adjust the number of servers to ensure your application can handle the current traffic load and remains available during traffic spikes or outages.

Cost efficiency: By automatically launching or terminating servers based on demand, you can scale resources up or down to match your needs, avoiding over-provisioning.

Automatic scaling: They automatically add or remove instances (e.g., Amazon EC2 instances) within specified minimum and maximum capacity limits.
